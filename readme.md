# Prime Weekend Challenge 05

###Description
This is the LAST weekend challenge!

In this challenge, you will be creating a Pet Application that allows a user to create Pets that are stored in a database. Then, in another view, the user can see the list of pets.

You will need three views:

Home view - Nothing special, just greeting the user, giving them direction on how to use the application,

1. Add view - This page will allow the user to add a new pet with a form,

2. Pets view - Meaning that the user can see a list of the entered pets.

3. You will use the full MEAN stack for this (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node)

Each Pet will need to have the following information: - Name (example, Grilled Cheese) - Animal (example, Cat), - Age (example, 14) - Image Url

Everyone, post info and image URL links to your pets in the nu room for everyone!

###Hard Mode
Look into delete functionality with Mongoose and add a button in the Pets view to delete a pet from the database. This will require research in how to identify the pet that is supposed to be deleted from the database.

###Pro Mode
Look into Filtering. In the Pets view, include a button to turn on Alphabetical Sorting of the pets that can be toggled on and off.
